This project is only 80% done and still needs the following:  
* all links
* side nav bar
* proper fonts
* proper layout
* twitter links
* google analytics
* fix load time of main comma background
* fix timing of internal camera video
* featured articles overflows
* email on bottom of page does not have submit button
* top nav bar does not follow scroll
* likely many more
