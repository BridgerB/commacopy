I spent two days rewriting the homepage of comma.ai in SvelteKit.  
This took ~400 lines of code.  
You can see it in action here: [https://commacopy.web.app/](https://commacopy.web.app/) (mobile version needs work)  
This is currently hosted on google firebase free tier

This project is only 80% done and still needs the following:  
* main video doesn't play on mobile
* all links
* side navbar/menu
* proper fonts
* proper layout
* twitter links
* fix text timing of internal camera video
* email on bottom of page does not have submit button
* top nav bar does not scroll with page
* likely many more
